# Assumes an LCD with standard Hitachi HD44780 controller chip wired using four data lines
# Code has only been tested on two line LCD displays.

# My code is based on this program written for the Raspberry Pi

# ********************************** GLOBAL CONSTANTS: TARGET BOARD PIN NUMBERS *************************************

# Supply board pin numbers as a tuple in order Rs, E, D4, D5, D6, D7

PINLIST = ('Y1','Y2','Y6','Y5','Y4','Y3')  # As used in testing.

# Initstring:
# 0x33, 0x32: See flowchart P24 send 3,3,3,2
# 0x28: Function set DL = 1 (4 bit) N = 1 (2 lines) F = 0 (5*8 bit font)
# 0x0C: Display on/off: D = 1 display on C, B = 0 cursor off, blink off
# 0x06: Entry mode set: ID = 1 increment S = 0 display shift??
# 0x01: Clear display, set DDRAM address = 0
# Original code had timing delays of 50uS. Testing with the Pi indicates that time.sleep() can't issue delays shorter
# than about 250uS. There also seems to be an error in the original code in that the datasheet specifies a delay of
# >4.1mS after the first 3 is sent. To simplify I've imposed a delay of 5mS after each initialisation pulse: the time to
# initialise is hardly critical. The original code worked, but I'm happier with something that complies with the spec.

# Async version:
# No point in having a message queue: people's eyes aren't that quick. Just display the most recent data for each line.
# Assigning changed data to the LCD object sets a "dirty" flag for that line. The LCD's runlcd thread then updates the
# hardware and clears the flag

# lcd_byte and lcd_nybble method use explicit delays. This is because execution
# time is short relative to general latency (on the order of 300μs).
