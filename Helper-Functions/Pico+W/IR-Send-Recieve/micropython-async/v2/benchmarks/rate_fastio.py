# rate_fastio.py Benchmark for uasyncio. Author Peter Hinch July 2018.
# This version tests the fast_io version when I/O is not pending.
# Benchmark uasyncio round-robin scheduling performance
# This measures the rate at which uasyncio can schedule a minimal coro which
# mereley increments a global.

# This is identical to rate.py but instantiates io and lp queues
# Outcome: minimal coros are scheduled at an interval of ~206Î¼s
