# Version 1 PCB Notes


## Issues

### REsolved:
- Trace for Display SCL was wrong, needed to go to correct GPIO with I2C1


### Not resolved
- Round edges so they are not sharp

- Instead of m3 holes do m2 so the 3.5 mm inserts can be used to shorten height from 6pm m3 inserts 

- Put Pico Sideways? Will all the GPIO's fit on one side?

- 1 Resistor for LED's

- Female Headers correctly alighed: ex 180 degree rotate the LED one.

- Metal around holes in PCB?
